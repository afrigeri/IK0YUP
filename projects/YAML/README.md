## Yet Another Magnetic Loop
### February-March 2018

I grow up in a small town, where a fishing rod out of the window and the complicity of super-strong japan-made samurai finals, were more than enough to enjoy the radio amateur hobby.

Since I moved to Rome I realized that the monster-sized towns are the cradle of every kind of interfering signals.  The initial frustration has trasformed soon into a challeninging interest into [RFI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_interference) and how to survive to them.

The solution I've found is to build an antenna system which is small enough for an apartment balcony and very selective.

The obvious solution is to put toghether the ideas for this Yet Another Magnetic Loop, which is nothin new but a synthesis of what I've found around.


### Materials

The loop antenna is basically a big RLC circuit, where L and C are respectively the loop and the capacitor.

__Loop conductor__ Current runs on the surface of the conductor.  A 3/4 inch or 2 cm copper pipe represents a good compromise.  The bigger the conductor the lower is the resistance, and the larger the bandwidth. 

__Variable Capacitor__ For 100W we should expect at least 4000V between the plates of the capacitor.  It takes 1mm for 3300V to generate and arc.

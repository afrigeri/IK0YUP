# Yet Another Magnetic Loop
## by IK0YUP

I grow up in a small town, where a fishing rod out of the window and the complicity of super-strong japan-made samurai finals, was more than enough to enjoy the hobby.

Since I moved to Rome I realized that the monster-sized towns are the cradle of every kind of interfering signals.  The initial frustration trasformed into a challeninging interest into RFI and how to survive to them.

The current solution is to build an antenna system which is small enough for an apartment balcony and really selective.

The obvious solution is to put toghether the ideas for [Yet Another Magnetic Loop](projects/YAML)

### Materials

__Loop conductor__ Current runs on the surface of the conductor.  A 3/4 inch or 2 cm copper pipe represents a good compromise.  The bigger the conductor the lower is the resistance, and the larger the bandwidth. 

__Variable Capacitor__ For 100W we should expect at least 4000V between the plates of the capacitor.  It takes 1mm for 3300V to generate and arc. 

Bought at an Ebay auction for 12â‚¬: 500pF.

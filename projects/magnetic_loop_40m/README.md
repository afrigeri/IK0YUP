# IK0YUP Magnetic Loop



### Materials

__Loop conductor__ Current runs on the surface of the conductor.  A 3/4 inch or 2 cm copper pipe represents a good compromise.  The bigger the conductor the lower is the resistance, and the larger the bandwidth. 

__Variable Capacitor__ For 100W we should expect at least 4000V between the plates of the capacitor.  It takes 1mm for 3300V to generate and arc. 

Bought at an Ebay auction for 12â‚¬: 500pF.

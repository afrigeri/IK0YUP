Every radio amateur operator becomes a skilled one getting hands dirt on projects.  Here are some which I like to share with other OMs.

 * [YAML - Yet Another Magnetic Loop](YAML/) is a project of a good antenna for small spaces

 * [Experiments on the Kenwood TM-721](TM-721E/) putting hands on the old-but-beautiful Kenwood TM-721E

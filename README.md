## Welcome to IK0YUP GitHub Pages

Here you can find ideas and projects which I share with other radio amateurs worldwide.  


### CW 

I like CW a lot.  Since I was a young radio amateur, CW qso's fascinated me a lot.  Now that I grow up, and CW is not officially used anymore, it's like learning another language, keeping the mind fresh, and keeping on contacting OMs worldwide!

If you want to improve your CW headcopy and getting wiser at the same time, this is for you.

### Hardware Projects

#### YAML - Yet Another Magnetic Loop

I grow up in a small town, where a fishing rod out of the window and the complicity of super-strong japan-made samurai finals, was more than enough to enjoy the hobby.

Since I moved to Rome I realized that the monster-sized towns are the cradle of every kind of interfering signals.  The initial frustration trasformed into a challeninging interest into RFI and how to survive to them.

The current solution is to build an antenna system which is small enough for an apartment balcony and really selective.

The obvious solution is to put toghether the ideas for [Yet Another Magnetic Loop](projects/YAML)

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

#### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/afrigeri/IK0YUP/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# Plugins on GitHub Pages
# GitHub Pages is powered by Jekyll. All GitHub Pages sites are generated using the --safe option 
# to disable plugins (with the exception of some whitelisted plugins) for security reasons. 
# Unfortunately, this means your plugins won't work if you’re deploying via GitHub Pages.
#
# You can still use GitHub Pages to publish your site, but you'll need to either build 
# the site locally and push the generated files to your GitHub repository or use GitHub 
# Actions to host source files on GitHub yet build and deploy with full control on GitHub Pages.

Approaching the end of the Level 2 [CWOps](https://www.cwops.org/) training course, my CW advisor Keith G0HKC gave to the class a very challenging exercise, which was the CW version of the [Old Man and the Sea](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea) by [Ernest Hemingway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernest_Hemingway), encoded by [Petr OK7AN](https://www.ok2cqr.com/hamradio/morse-code/122-the-old-man-and-the-sea-in-morse).  This way, for me the morse code finished completely to be a bunch of dit and dahs to be decoded and used for QSOs and became a language to learn.  

Incidentally yesterday I came by an excerpt from a book of [Alejandro Jodorowsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alejandro_Jodorowsky) which I've found to be ideal for CW head-copy for two main reasons.  Firstly, they are a list of not-dependent phrases, so if you loose one you can still go on and copy the next one.  Then, since the contents are partuclarly inspiring, I found that decoding becomes a discover.

I've formatted the text a bit and using DJ1YFK's very good [ebook2cw](https://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html) I've produced the mp3 file you can download and enjoy.

Here is the [text](82_commandments.txt) of the files above.

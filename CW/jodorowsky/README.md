## Alejandro Jodorowsky's 82 commandments in Morse Code
##### March 6th, 2018

Approaching the end of the Level 2 [CWOps](https://www.cwops.org/) training course, my advisor Keith G0HKC gave a very challenging exercise, which was the CW version of the Old Man and the Sea by Ernest Hemingway.  This way, Morse Code finished completely to be a bunch of dit and dahs to be decoded - and become a language to learn.  

Incidentally I came by an excerpt from a book of Alejandro Jodorowsky which I've found to be ideal for CW head-copy for two main reasons.  They are a list of not-dependent phrases, and the contents are partuclarly inspiring - so decoding becomes truly a discover.

I've formatted the text a bit and using DJ1YFK's very good [ebook2cw](https://fkurz.net/ham/ebook2cw.html), i produced the mp3 file you can download and enjoy.
